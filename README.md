# ShieldAR - Harnessing machine learning to prevent atmospheric river damage
The water cycle is becoming an increasingly relevant area for climate studies due to its role in exacerbating global climatology challenges with agricultural infrastructure. A crucial part of this cycle includes atmospheric rivers (ARs), which transport vast amounts of water over long distances through narrow corridors of concentrated moisture. Despite the global and regional socioeconomic implications of these ARs on droughts and flooding, the current forecasting methods often rely on traditional meteorological models that may not adequately capture their variability and rapid development. The first contribution of this work is to compare traditional methods of AR detection and modernize this with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. Next, these features are used in two neural networks to understand the prediction capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for this problem. This predictive capability is then integrated into a hardware system and interface to demonstrate the proof-of-concept application of this technology into real-world systems. Deploying this novel system will lead to better detection and prediction of climate conditions at a significant lead time by equipping emergency responders and policymakers with advanced tools to respond to these emergencies.
